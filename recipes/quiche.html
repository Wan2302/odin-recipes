            <p>An easy recipe to prepare a tasty quiche.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups shredded Swiss cheese</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ cup cooked ham, diced</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground dry mustard</li>
                <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped pimento peppers, garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In medium bowl, toss 4 teaspoons flour with the grated cheese. Sprinkle mixture into the pie shell. On top of cheese, sprinkle 1/2 cup of diced ham.</li>
                <li>In medium bowl, combine eggs, milk or cream, and then add salt and mustard powder. Beat until smooth and pour over cheese and ham.</li>
                <li>Put piece of plastic wrap large enough to overlap sides over top of quiche, then a piece of foil, and seal well around the edges. (plastic keeps the foil from sticking to the food). Place prepared quiche in freezer.</li>
                <li>When ready to prepare, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.) Remove foil and plastic wrap. Put foil around edge of crust to protect it.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until filling is set and crust is golden brown. Garnish with parsley and pimiento if desired.</li>
            </ol>
